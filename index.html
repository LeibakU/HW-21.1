            <h2>Hi, I am Sam</h2>
            <p>
                Even humans can envy this dog's disposition: 
                they are full of love and almost always in a good mood. 
                They are easy to work with in every sense:
                they are friendly, calm, playful, not only trainable, 
                but also obviously enjoy training and try their best to please their beloved owner.
                Labrador dogs easily make friends with people and animals. 
                They react to birds like hunters, but there are happy exceptions.
                Labradors are dogs for the family, they quickly become active members of it, 
                in their own way, but clearly participating in important and not so important events. 
                They need communication in the literal sense, and the peculiarity of the Labrador's 
                character is that the dogs manage not to bother. 
                They can adapt to a person's mood and even their habits.
                A dog can be taught to bring things, turn on the light, close/open doors: the dog's high
                intellectual abilities are evident.
